Project Lumina: A Roadmap for an Interactive AI Astrologer & Her Evolving Digital WorldDocument Version: 1.5 (Content Moderation Strategy Enhanced)Date: May 7, 2025Section 1: Introduction & Vision1.1. Overview of LuminaLumina is envisioned as a wise, empathetic, and engaging AI Astrologer. She will manifest as a 2D cartoon character, accompanied by her loyal dog, Cosmo. Her initial presence will be built through consistent, topical social media engagement (posts, comments, stories), drawing connections between current events/trends and astrological insights. The future phase will see her interacting with audiences in real-time via live streaming. Her primary role is to offer astrological insights, tarot readings, and mystical guidance, fostering a sense of connection, wonder, and gentle self-discovery.1.2. The Grand Vision: A Self-Generating World(Content remains the same as version 1.2)1.3. Core Philosophy: Interactivity & Novelty > Animation Polish(Content remains the same as version 1.2)Section 2: Minimum Viable Product (MVP) - Lumina: Socially Active & Preparing for LiveThe MVP will now be phased, focusing first on establishing Lumina's consistent presence and content delivery on social media, with an emphasis on topical relevance by integrating news and trend analysis. The live, interactive streaming components will be developed subsequently.2.1. Core MVP Features (Phased Approach):Phase A: Lumina's Social Media Presence (Initial Focus)AI-Powered Topical Content Generation:Primary Brain: Mistral-small:latest (via API) for generating insightful, persona-driven text content. This includes astrological thoughts, tarot card interpretations, mystical musings, social media captions, comments, and story content.Lumina's Persona: Defined by the detailed system prompt (Section 5.1.1).News & Trend Integration:Basic mechanisms to fetch current news headlines/summaries (e.g., via RSS feeds or news APIs).Ability to analyze simple trends (initially could be manually identified, later automated).LLM prompted to draw astrological connections between this current information and ongoing celestial events.(Optional) Tiny Coders (Local via LM Studio): For any structured data formatting if needed for complex post types.Static Visuals for Posts & Stories:Utilize pre-rendered images of Lumina and Cosmo to accompany text.Simple templates for "Card of the Day," "Cosmic Quote," "Astrological Hot Take on [Current Event]," etc.Automated & Semi-Automated Social Media Engagement:Python scripts to schedule and publish primary content (posts) to at least one platform (e.g., X/Twitter).Tools/scripts to assist in drafting relevant comments on trending topics or in response to other users (initially, AI generates draft, human reviews/posts).Content formatted for "story" features on platforms like Instagram/TikTok (text overlays on images/short video clips using static assets).Integration with social media APIs (X/Twitter, Meta platforms, TikTok - leveraging your existing API key access).Diverse Content Categories for Posting & Engagement:Topical Astrological Insights: Connecting current news/trends to astrological "weather" (e.g., "With Mercury entering Gemini amidst [current news event], expect communications to be swift and multifaceted! Here’s how to navigate it...").Astrological Commentary: Lumina's take on trending topics, framed through an astrological lens.Daily/Regular Astrological Insight (e.g., "Today's Moon phase and its gentle guidance").Card of the Day (image of a tarot card + Lumina's interpretation, perhaps linked to a daily theme).Mystical Musings or Short Poetic Reflections.Engaging questions to her audience, potentially related to current events.Phase B: Lumina Live - Foundations (To be developed after Phase A is stable)(Content remains the same as version 1.3)2.2. Technology Stack for MVP (Overall, with Phase A focus):(Content largely remains the same as version 1.3)Frontend (Lumina's Visuals & Animation - Primarily for Phase B, but assets used in Phase A):HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), optional GSAP.Backend (Orchestration, API, Social Media, Streaming Control):Python 3.9+Web Framework (FastAPI/Flask)HTTP Client: requests or aiohttp.News/Data Acquisition: Libraries like feedparser (for RSS), newsapi-python (for NewsAPI), or BeautifulSoup/requests (for basic scraping if necessary, though APIs are preferred for MVP).AI Brain:Primary: Mistral-small:latest (via API).Local Specialists (Optional for Phase A): LM Studio with GGUF models.Text-to-Speech (TTS) - Primarily for Phase B.Live Streaming Infrastructure - Primarily for Phase B.Social Media Integration - Core for Phase A:Python libraries: tweepy (X), facebook-sdk (Meta), tiktok-api-python (or similar, noting that official TikTok posting APIs for automated content can be restrictive; research specific capabilities for your accounts).Section 3: Roadmap to MVP Deployment (Social Media Posting First)This revised roadmap prioritizes establishing Lumina's social media presence and content engine, with a strong focus on topicality.Phase 1: Core AI, Persona, & Basic Data Feeds (Est. 1-2 Weeks)Environment Setup: (Same as v1.3)Mistral-small:latest API Integration: (Same as v1.3)Lumina's Persona Prompt Refinement (Section 5.1.1):Thoroughly test and refine Lumina's system prompt with Mistral-small:latest. Crucially, include instructions on how Lumina should approach connecting current events/trends to astrological themes in a balanced, insightful, and ethical manner.(Optional) LM Studio for Tiny Coders: (Same as v1.3)Static Asset Preparation: (Same as v1.3)Initial News/Trend Data Acquisition Setup:Identify 2-3 reliable RSS feeds for general news or specific topics relevant to Lumina (e.g., culture, wellness, science).Write a simple Python script using feedparser to fetch and parse headlines/summaries from these feeds.Alternatively, if you have a NewsAPI key, set up basic queries to fetch top headlines in relevant categories.For "trends," initially, this might involve manually noting trending hashtags or topics from a chosen platform and feeding them as context to Lumina. Full trend analysis automation is post-MVP.Phase 2: Topical Social Media Content Engine & Posting Pipeline (Est. 2-4 Weeks)Content Strategy & Prompts for Topical Content:Define content categories that leverage current events (e.g., "Astrological Angle on Today's Headlines," "Cosmic Commentary on [Trending Topic]," "How [Current Astrological Transit] Amplifies [News Event]").Develop sophisticated prompts for Mistral-small:latest that provide:Lumina's core persona.The fetched news headline/summary or trend information.Current key astrological data (e.g., "Mars is in Aries, Full Moon in Libra on [date]").Instructions to weave these elements into an insightful post, comment, or story idea.Design simple visual templates for posts that can incorporate topical text.Python Backend for Topical Content Generation:Enhance Python scripts to:Fetch latest news/trends using the mechanisms from Phase 1.Select relevant astrological data (this might be manually updated for MVP or fetched from a simple ephemeris library).Formulate the multi-input prompt for Mistral-small:latest.Generate text content.Pair with appropriate static visuals.Social Media API Integration & Posting Logic (Initial Platform + Comment/Story Prep):Solidify posting to your primary chosen platform (e.g., X/Twitter).Develop functions to generate draft comments based on a news item or trending post. Initially, these drafts would be reviewed by you before posting.Develop functions to format content for "stories" (e.g., text snippets for image overlays). Your existing API keys for Meta and TikTok will be useful here for future direct posting, but for MVP, focus on generating the content that can be used in stories.Basic Scheduling & Automation: (Same as v1.3, but now scheduling topical content generation runs).Logging and Monitoring: (Same as v1.3).Phase 3 & 4: Foundation for Live Streaming & Interactive Features (Future Phases)(Content remains the same as version 1.3)Section 4: Post-MVP - Building the "Giant Canvas" & Evolving World(Content remains the same as version 1.2. News/Trend data will feed the vector DB here.)Section 5: Technical Deep Dives5.1. LM Studio Setup (Detailed Steps)(Content remains the same as version 1.2)5.1.1. Lumina's Enhanced Persona System Prompt for Mistral-small:latest(Content remains the same as version 1.2. Ensure it includes guidance on handling news/trends sensitively and ethically.)5.2. Recommended TTS Solutions (Fast, Pre-trained)(Content remains the same as version 1.2)5.3. File Structure Recommendation(Updated to reflect news/trend integration for MVP)lumina_project/

(Self-correction: Renamed data_harvesting for MVP to data_ingestion for clarity, as it's about immediate use for topical posts. The more comprehensive data_harvesting for the vector DB remains a post-MVP concept. Added specific poster files for Meta and TikTok to reflect API key availability, though full automation on all might be staged within Phase A/B).5.4. Headless Live Streaming (Recap & Key Python Logic)(Content remains the same as version 1.2)Section 6: Considerations & Future Steps(Content from version 1.2 largely remains, with "Responsible AI Commentary" expanded)Hardware Progression: Your plan (3090Ti -> Dual 3090Ti -> 48GB VRAM -> Cloud) is solid. Monitor VRAM usage closely, especially when running the LLM, headless browser, and potentially local TTS simultaneously.Ethical AI & Responsible AI Commentary:When Lumina comments on news and trends, or interacts in general, it's vital to ensure her responses are sensitive, avoid misinformation, and align with ethical guidelines.Mitigating Undesirable Outputs (Hallucinations, Insensitivity):Robust Prompt Engineering: Lumina's system prompt (Section 5.1.1) is the first line of defense. It must contain explicit instructions about her tone, topics to avoid (e.g., hate speech, harmful advice, overly controversial political stances unless specifically designed to be discussed neutrally), and how to approach sensitive current events. The goal is constructive, insightful, and astrologically-themed perspectives.Negative Prompts: If the chosen LLM API supports it, use negative prompts to further specify what Lumina should not say or do (e.g., "DO NOT generate responses that are dismissive, judgmental, or promote conspiracy theories.").Content Filtering & Moderation:Human Oversight (Crucial for MVP): Especially for topical content and initial social media comments/stories, a human review step before publishing is highly recommended. This allows for catching and correcting any off-brand, inaccurate, or potentially upsetting generated text.Automated Filtering (Future Enhancement & MVP Lite):Implement keyword/phrase blacklists for obviously problematic terms.Integrate pre-trained toxicity classifiers (from Hugging Face or cloud APIs) to score generated text for harmful content categories.Sanitization with Replacements: For less severe vulgarity or specific "choice words" that don't align with Lumina's refined persona but aren't outright harmful, implement a system to replace them with placeholders like "-BEEP-", "-CENSORED-", or a more thematic "[Cosmic Static]". This can add a layer of humor or brand consistency while still filtering. This should be configurable and used judiciously to maintain a natural feel.Flag content exceeding a certain toxicity/vulgarity threshold for mandatory human review or automatic rejection.Sentiment Analysis (Future Enhancement): As a more advanced step, sentiment analysis could be run on Lumina's drafted responses. If a strongly negative or inappropriate sentiment is detected, the post could be flagged for human review or automatically discarded/regenerated.Focus on Core Persona: Continuously reinforce Lumina's established persona (empathetic, wise, supportive, playful but responsible) through prompt engineering. If a generated response deviates significantly, it's a sign the prompt needs adjustment or the context was misinterpreted by the LLM.Iterative Learning from Feedback: Actively monitor audience reactions to Lumina's posts and interactions. Any instances of perceived insensitivity or problematic content should be treated as critical feedback to refine prompts, guardrails, and review processes.Clear Disclaimers: Ensure Lumina's profiles and content include disclaimers that she is an AI and her insights are for entertainment and reflection, not professional advice.Community Building: Actively engage with your audience. Their feedback will be invaluable for shaping Lumina's development and the world she inhabits.Monetization (Future): While not the current focus, the interactive nature and unique content could open avenues like YouTube Super Chat, channel memberships, sponsored segments (handled ethically by Lumina), or even unique NFT-gated experiences/interactions post-MVP.Scalability of "Infinite Canvas": While conceptually infinite, rendering an extremely large and complex HTML DOM can hit browser performance limits. Strategies like virtual scrolling (only rendering visible parts), LOD (Level of Detail) for distant elements, and optimizing JS will be needed as the world grows.Section 7: Questions for You(Content remains the same as version 1.2)This document provides a comprehensive blueprint. The journey to bring Lumina and her world to life will be iterative and filled with learning. Focus on the MVP phases, get Lumina streaming and interacting, and then progressively build out the incredible, dynamic world you envision! Your emphasis on interactivity is spot on for creating something truly special.
